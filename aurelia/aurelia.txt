Aurelia is a JavaScript front-end framework. 
It's similar to frameworks like Angular, Ember and React.

Before we get everything installed we'll assume you have Node and npm installed.
If not I would highly recommend nvm.
It's a version manager for Node.
Check for the instructions on the website on how to install it.

We also need jspm. This tool is another package management system.

$ mkdir HelloWorld
$ cd HelloWorld
$ npm install jspm -g
$ npm install http-server -g

$ jspm init
At this point you'll be prompted if you want certain config files to be created. Just hit enter through everything.

Next make sure you have jspm installed locally.

$ npm install jspm --save-dev

Now we can install two framework packages for Aurelia.
First we'll install the aurelia framework then the aurelia bootstrapper.

$ jspm install aurelia-framework aurelia-bootstrapper

aurelia-app in the <body> tag

point to system.js && config.js via script

System.import('aurelia-bootstrapper');

Now that we have our src files, let's go back to the main folder and edit the config.js file.
We'll need to specify the src folder in our path as well as add some more babelOptions.

From 
  babelOptions: {
    "optional": [
      "runtime",
      "optimisation.modules.system"
    ]
  },
  paths: {
    "github:*": "jspm_packages/github/*",
    "npm:*": "jspm_packages/npm/*"
  },
